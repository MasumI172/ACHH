## Deploy to Render.com (5-minute process)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# In your project folder
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial deployment - Arabian Coast Holiday Homes"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Connect to Render.com
1. Go to render.com and sign up/login
2. Click "New Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Use these settings:
   - **Build Command**: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - **Start Command**: `npm run start`
   - **Environment**: Node.js
   - **Plan**: Free tier

### Step 3: Add Database
1. In Render dashboard, create "New PostgreSQL"
2. Copy the database URL
3. Add to your web service environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` = your postgres URL
   - `NODE_ENV` = production

### Step 4: Deploy!
Click "Deploy" and wait 3-5 minutes for your site to go live.

## What Happens Next

**âœ… Your website will have:**
- Professional luxury property rental platform
- Real-time booking calendar with Hostex sync
- Beautiful guidebook with attraction images
- Fast global delivery
- Automatic HTTPS
- Custom domain support

**âš¡ Performance:**
- Optimized images for fast loading
- CDN delivery via Render
- Mobile-responsive design
- Professional hosting

## Alternative: Full Image Gallery

If you want ALL 135 images (for property galleries):
1. Sign up for Cloudinary (free 25GB)
2. Upload all `attached_assets/` files
3. Run the cloudinary migration script I created
4. Update your cloud name and deploy

## Support

Your `.gitignore` already excludes `attached_assets/` so GitHub won't have size issues. The essential images are now in `public/` and will deploy perfectly.
