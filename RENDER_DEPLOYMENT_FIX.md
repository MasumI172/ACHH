# Fix Render.com Deployment - Vite Module Error

## The Problem
The production build is trying to import Vite modules that should only run in development.

## Solution: Update Render.com Settings

### Step 1: Update Build Command in Render.com
Change your Render.com build command to:
```bash
npm ci && npm run build
```

### Step 2: Update Start Command in Render.com
Change your Render.com start command to:
```bash
npm run start
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
In Render.com, add these environment variables:
- `NODE_ENV` = `production`
- `DATABASE_URL` = your PostgreSQL connection string

### Step 4: Alternative Start Command
If the above doesn't work, try this alternative start command:
```bash
NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js
```

## What This Fixes
- Prevents Vite from loading in production
- Uses pre-built static files from dist/public
- Proper environment detection for production mode
- Serves your Arabian Coast website correctly

## Your Website Will Have
- All property booking functionality
- Real-time calendar with Hostex integration
- Guidebook with Dubai attraction images
- WhatsApp booking integration
- Professional hosting with SSL

The Vite error happens because the server tries to load development tools in production. Setting NODE_ENV=production properly will fix this.
