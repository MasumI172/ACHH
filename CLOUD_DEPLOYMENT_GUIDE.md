# Cloud Deployment Guide for Arabian Coast Holiday Homes

## Overview
This guide helps you deploy to Render.com while preserving all images and functionality by moving large assets to cloud storage.

## Problem
- GitHub has file size limits (100MB repository, 25MB individual files)
- Your `attached_assets` folder is 26MB with high-quality images
- Render.com needs to pull from GitHub, so we need a clean repository

## Solution: Cloud Asset Storage

### Option 1: Cloudinary (Recommended)
**Free tier**: 25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth/month

1. **Sign up for Cloudinary**:
   - Go to cloudinary.com
   - Create free account
   - Note your cloud name, API key, and API secret

2. **Upload your images**:
   - Use Cloudinary's web interface to bulk upload all files from `attached_assets/`
   - Keep the same file names for easy mapping

3. **Update your code**:
   - Replace local image paths with Cloudinary URLs
   - Format: `https://res.cloudinary.com/YOUR_CLOUD_NAME/image/upload/v1/FILENAME`

### Option 2: GitHub LFS (Large File Storage)
**Cost**: $5/month for 50GB

1. **Install Git LFS**:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```

2. **Track large files**:
   ```bash
   git lfs track "attached_assets/*"
   git add .gitattributes
   ```

3. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add attached_assets/
   git commit -m "Add images via LFS"
   git push
   ```

### Option 3: AWS S3 + CloudFront
**Cost**: ~$1-3/month

1. **Create S3 bucket**:
   - AWS Console → S3 → Create bucket
   - Enable public read access for images

2. **Upload files**:
   - Use AWS CLI or web interface
   - Set proper content types for images

3. **Set up CloudFront**:
   - Create distribution for fast global delivery
   - Point to your S3 bucket

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Choose Your Cloud Provider
I recommend Cloudinary for simplicity and generous free tier.

### Step 2: Upload Assets
Upload all files from `attached_assets/` to your chosen service.

### Step 3: Update Code References
I'll help you update all image references in your code to use cloud URLs.

### Step 4: Create Clean Repository
Create new GitHub repo without large files for Render.com deployment.

### Step 5: Deploy to Render.com
Connect Render.com to your clean GitHub repository.
